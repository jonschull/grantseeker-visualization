## Previous Milestone: Robust Modular Checkbox–URL Sync

### Summary
- All objectives for modular, robust checkbox–URL synchronization are complete.
- The implementation has been regression tested and validated with no errors.
- Documentation and changelog have been updated.
- System is ready for next milestone or handoff.

### Details
#### Problem Statement
As the GrantSeekerWeb visualization evolves, the UI state (especially checkbox selections) must remain robust, shareable, and recoverable—even as the underlying data model (e.g., Funders, Propositions) changes. The primary challenges are:
- **Stable state encoding:** Ensure users can share/bookmark precise UI states via URLs.
- **Data evolution resilience:** Adding, removing, or reordering records (e.g., new Funders) must not break saved URLs or user workflows.
- **Recovery:** If record IDs change (e.g., due to data migration), there must be a basis for reconstructing or diagnosing lost state.

#### Approach
- **URL-Driven UI State:** Each checkbox is assigned a unique, stable identifier (record ID). The URL encodes state by ID. Special-case checkboxes use reserved IDs. Note: Browser URL length limits apply for very large numbers of checked boxes.
- **Embedded RECORD_NAME_ID Mapping:** Every HTML output includes a mapping of `{Record Name: Record ID}` for all checkboxes, enabling diagnostics and possible recovery if IDs change.
- **Architecture:**
  - HTML generation assigns IDs/names, embeds mapping
  - JS parses URL on load, updates on change, uses mapping for diagnostics
  - Special-case checkboxes handled separately
- **Risks & Mitigations:**
  - ID instability, name collisions, outdated canonical HTML, subtle breakages, URL length
  - Mitigations: diagnostics, loud failure, documentation, manual validation, atomic commits, rollback
