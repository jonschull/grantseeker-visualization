# System Milestone Changelog

A simple, auditable log of key incremental achievements, decisions, and state changes across the GrantSeekerWeb system. Each entry is timestamped, associated with a commit hash, and described clearly for future reference. This log is intended to outlast any single benchmark or milestone and should be updated as a discipline after each significant, reviewable change.

| Date & Time           | Achievement/Action                                       | Commit Hash | Author      | Notes/Links                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| 2025-07-16 15:40 EDT  | Complete robust, modular checkboxâ€“URL sync; regression tested and documented; milestone complete. | [commit] | [Your Name] | Modularization, initialization order fix, regression test, docs updated. See `System/visualization/stateful_checkbox_architecture.md` for full rationale and design. |
| 2025-07-15 21:01 EDT  | Freeze validated HTML as Golden Master                   | a16675c     | [Your Name] | Initial canonical HTML     |
| 2025-07-15 21:03 EDT  | Add regression test script (reviewed, tested, committed) | f39124b     | [Your Name] | Script: compare_to_golden.py |
| 2025-07-15 21:12 EDT  | Update bootstrap workflow to explicitly load and reference milestone changelog | 48fff13     | [Your Name] | .windsurf/workflows/bootstrap.md now ensures System/milestone_changelog.md is always recovered and acknowledged |
| 2025-07-15 22:55 EDT  | Promote stamp-enabled HTML output as new Golden Master (includes code/data versioning for reproducibility) | 9c906a3     | jonschull   | HTML, Python, and mapping versions now paired in metadata |
| 2025-07-16 14:47 EDT  | Update milestone plan: robust, incremental, and AI/human-friendly stateful checkbox architecture. See current_milestone.md section 7 for new stepwise implementation plan. | [commit] | [Your Name] | Plan emphasizes modular sync logic, regression testing, onboarding discipline |

## Usage
- **Who updates:** Anyone making a significant, reviewable change to the system.
- **When:** Immediately after the change is committed and validated.
- **How:** Add a new row with date/time, description, commit hash, author, and optional notes/links.
- **Where:** This file lives at `System/milestone_changelog.md` and is referenced in onboarding and bootstrap documentation.

**Process Note:**
- When updating the changelog, always reference the commit hash of the substantive change (e.g., a workflow, code, or process update), not the hash of the changelog update itself. This avoids infinite regress and maintains clear, auditable project history.

## Rationale
Maintaining this changelog ensures:
- Transparent, auditable project history
- Easy onboarding for new contributors
- Reliable rollback and review of key decisions
- Institutional memory beyond any single milestone
