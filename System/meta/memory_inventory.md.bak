# Memory Inventory: GrantSeekerWeb

This document summarizes the key project memories, principles, and context critical for AI and human handoff. It should be updated at every major milestone.

---

## 1. SD4D & Development Guidelines
- Consultative approach: Always seek explicit approval before implementing changes.
- Never assume server restarts or implicit state; processes must be idempotent and recoverable.
- All steps, rationale, and documentation standards (AI-handoff, one_right_way, SD4D) are followed and reflected in code and docs.
- Authoritative reference: `mar17b architecture.md` (re-read at the start of every session).

## 2. Documentation Standards
- All documentation is written with the assumption that a new AI system may take over at any time.
- Every function must have clear docstrings (purpose, params, returns, side effects, dependencies).
- System-level docs must explain architecture, data flow, workflows, failure modes, and state management.
- All assumptions and implicit knowledge must be made explicit.

## 3. Pipeline Workflow & Handoff
- The pipeline is orchestrated via a single script, using only relative paths for portability.
- Testing and migration plan: (1) Test in canonical location, (2) Copy and test in new project, (3) Mothball legacy code.
- All rationale and workflow are recorded in session memory and codebase docs for future maintainers.

## 4. Additional Context
- See `meta/Working_Agreement.md` for working philosophy.
- See `README.md` for onboarding and project overview.
